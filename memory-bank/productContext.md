# Product Context: MCP-Agent

## 1. Problem Solved

Developing new products or features often involves a manual and time-consuming process of:

- Deconstructing product requirements into specific functionalities (use cases).
- Researching available technologies, protocols, or APIs that can implement these functionalities.
The MCP-agent aims to automate and accelerate this discovery phase.

## 2. How It Should Work (Ideal User Experience)

1. **User Input:** The user provides a description of their product or feature, or a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD).
2. **Agent Analysis:** The MCP-agent parses this input.
3. **Use Case Generation:** The agent intelligently identifies and lists key use cases implied by the requirements.
4. **Solution Discovery:** For each use case, the agent searches for and suggests one or more relevant MCPs or APIs.
5. **Results Presentation:** The user receives a clear report linking product requirements to use cases and potential technical solutions.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** Easy for users to input their requirements.
- **Clarity:** Clear and understandable breakdown of use cases.
- **Relevance:** Accurate and relevant suggestions for MCPs/APIs.
- **Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the time spent on initial technical research.
