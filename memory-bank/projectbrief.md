# Project Brief: MCP-Agent

## 1. Project Overview

The project is to build an "MCP-agent." This agent will assist users by taking product requirements (e.g., PRDs, descriptions) as input, generating relevant use cases from these requirements, and then identifying suitable Model Context Protocols (MCPs) or APIs for each use case by searching the internet.

## 2. Core Requirements

- **Input:** Accept product requirements in textual format.
- **Processing:**
  - Analyze input to generate a list of distinct use cases.
  - For each use case, search the internet for relevant MCPs or APIs.
- **Output:** Present the generated use cases and the corresponding suggested MCPs/APIs.

## 3. Goals

- To automate the initial phase of technical discovery for new product features or ideas.
- To help users quickly identify potential technical solutions (MCPs/APIs) for their needs.
- To streamline the process of translating product requirements into actionable technical components.
