# Active Context: MCP-Agent

## 1. Current Focus

- Implementing a Gradio Web UI for the MCP-Agent.
- Ensuring the Gradio UI correctly utilizes the existing backend logic (`InputParser`, `UseCaseGenerator`, `FlowchartGenerator`, `SearchManager`).
- Updating Memory Bank documentation to reflect the new UI.

## 2. Recent Achievements & Decisions

- **Gradio UI Implemented:**
  - Created `src/gradio_app.py` to provide a web interface for the MCP-Agent.
  - The UI allows users to input product requirements and displays generated use cases, Mermaid flowcharts, and recommended MCPs.
  - The Gradio app reuses the existing core logic from `src/` modules.
  - Added `gradio` to `requirements.txt`.
- **Flowchart Generation Implemented:**
  - Created `src/flowchart_generator.py` with `FlowchartGenerator` class and `FlowchartResponse` Pydantic model.
  - `FlowchartGenerator` uses `gpt-4.1-mini` (via `instructor` and OpenAI client) to generate Mermaid code for use cases.
  - Developed unit tests for `FlowchartGenerator` in `tests/unit/test_flowchart_generator.py`.
- **Main Application (`src/main.py`) Updated:**
  - Integrated `FlowchartGenerator` into the main loop.
  - For each use case, `main.py` now:
    - Generates use cases.
    - Generates a Mermaid flowchart for each use case.
    - Searches for MCPs/APIs.
    - Prints the use case description, flowchart (as a Mermaid code block), and search results directly to the console.
  - Updated unit tests in `tests/unit/test_main.py` to cover the new flowchart generation step and modified output.
- **`ResultsFormatter` Deferred:** Decided to defer the implementation of `src/results_formatter.py`. Output is currently handled directly in `main.py`.
- **Previous Achievements (Still Relevant):**
  - Successfully implemented the `UseCaseGenerator` module (`src/use_case_generator.py`) using OpenAI's JSON mode and Pydantic models for structured output.
  - Developed comprehensive unit tests for `UseCaseGenerator` (`tests/unit/test_use_case_generator.py`).
  - Integrated `UseCaseGenerator` into `src/main.py`.
  - Agreed on the core Memory Bank file structure and initial content.
  - Confirmed Python as the primary programming language.
  - Decided on a project structure (`src/`, `tests/unit/`) and `python-dotenv` for environment variables.
  - Outlined the MCP-agent architecture (now updated to include `FlowchartGenerator` and defer `ResultsFormatter`).
  - Reviewed and confirmed the initial implementations for user input (`src/main.py`), input parsing (`src/input_parser.py`), and logging/configuration (`src/config.py`).
  - Successfully scaffolded the `SearchEngine` module (`src/search_engine/`) including `SearchManager`, `SearchResult` model, `BaseSourceHandler`.
  - Implemented an advanced `GitHubSource` (`src/search_engine/sources/github_source.py`) using LLM analysis of curated GitHub READMEs, local caching, dynamic updates, and star fetching.
  - Developed unit tests for `GitHubSource` (`tests/unit/test_github_source.py`).
  - Added relevant configurations to `src/config.py` for `SearchManager` and `GitHubSource`.
  - Confirmed `SearchManager` integration in `src/main.py` with asynchronous operation.

## 3. Next Steps (Implementation Phase)

- (Deferred to next iteration: Implement `PipedreamMCPSource` (web scraping) and its unit tests).
- (Deferred to next iteration: Implement `MCPMarketSource` (web scraping) and its unit tests).
- (Deferred to next iteration: Update `_initialize_source_handlers` in `SearchManager` to load these new handlers).
- (Deferred: Implement `ResultsFormatter` module and its tests, and integrate into `src/main.py`).
- Test the Gradio UI thoroughly with various inputs.
- **Fixed `AttributeError: type object 'Tab' has no attribute 'update'` in `src/gradio_app.py` by changing `gr.Tab.update()` and `gr.Markdown.update()` to `gr.update()`.**
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the completion of the Gradio UI, recent fixes, and other Memory Bank updates.
- Consider creating a project `README.md`.

## 4. Key Considerations & Learnings

- LLM prompt engineering is crucial for `UseCaseGenerator`, `GitHubSource`, and now also for `FlowchartGenerator` to ensure valid and useful Mermaid output.
- The `instructor` library significantly simplifies getting structured Pydantic model responses from the LLM.
- Robust interaction with diverse external data sources for the MCP/API Search Engine remains complex.
- Asynchronous operations are vital for performance, as demonstrated in `SearchManager` and `GitHubSource`, and handled by Gradio for UI functions.
- Auto-formatting by the editor needs to be considered for future file modifications (SEARCH/REPLACE blocks).
- The `gradio` library provides a quick way to build interactive UIs for Python applications.
