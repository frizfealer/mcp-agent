# Active Context: MCP-Agent

## 1. Current Focus

- Planning and beginning implementation of the `SearchEngine` module (`src/search_engine/`).
- Updating Memory Bank documentation (this current task).

## 2. Recent Achievements & Decisions

- Successfully implemented the `UseCaseGenerator` module (`src/use_case_generator.py`) using OpenAI's JSON mode and Pydantic models for structured output.
- Developed comprehensive unit tests for `UseCaseGenerator` (`tests/unit/test_use_case_generator.py`), ensuring its reliability.
- Integrated `UseCaseGenerator` into `src/main.py`, allowing it to process user input and display generated use cases.
- Agreed on the core Memory Bank file structure and initial content.
- Confirmed Python as the primary programming language.
- Decided on a project structure (`src/`, `tests/unit/`) and `python-dotenv` for environment variables.
- Outlined the MCP-agent architecture: Input Parser, LLM-based Use Case Generator, MCP/API Search Engine (with specific sources), Results Formatter (Markdown), and Console Output.
- Reviewed and confirmed the initial implementations for user input (`src/main.py`), input parsing (`src/input_parser.py`), and logging/configuration (`src/config.py`) are sensible and provide a good foundation.

## 3. Next Steps (Implementation Phase)

- Begin detailed planning and scaffolding for the `SearchEngine` module (`src/search_engine/`).
  - Define `SearchManager` class.
  - Outline interfaces for individual source handlers (e.g., GitHub, web sources).
- Develop initial unit tests for the `SearchEngine` components.
- Develop/update unit tests for `src/main.py` to cover its current functionality (including `InputParser` and `UseCaseGenerator` interaction).
- Update `progress.md` to reflect these advancements (if further major changes occur).

## 4. Key Considerations & Learnings

- LLM prompt engineering will be crucial for the Use Case Generator.
- Robust interaction with diverse external data sources for the MCP/API Search Engine will be complex.
- Asynchronous operations will be important for performance.
- Auto-formatting by the editor needs to be considered for future file modifications (SEARCH/REPLACE blocks).
