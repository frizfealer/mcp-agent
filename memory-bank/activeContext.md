# Active Context: MCP-Agent

## 1. Current Focus

- Implementing the `UseCaseGenerator` module.
- Integrating with LLM for use case extraction.
- Updating Memory Bank documentation.

## 2. Recent Decisions

- Agreed on the core Memory Bank file structure and initial content.
- Confirmed Python as the primary programming language.
- Decided on a project structure (`src/`, `tests/unit/`) and `python-dotenv` for environment variables.
- Outlined the MCP-agent architecture: Input Parser, LLM-based Use Case Generator, MCP/API Search Engine (with specific sources), Results Formatter (Markdown), and Console Output.
- Reviewed and confirmed the initial implementations for user input (`src/main.py`), input parsing (`src/input_parser.py`), and logging/configuration (`src/config.py`) are sensible and provide a good foundation.

## 3. Next Steps (Implementation Phase)

- Define the `UseCaseGenerator` class/functions in `src/use_case_generator.py`.
- Integrate with the OpenAI LLM API using `src/config.py` to fetch the API key.
- Define a Pydantic model specifying the desired JSON structure for the list of use cases.
- Develop initial prompt templates and configure the OpenAI API call to use JSON mode, ensuring the LLM's output conforms to the Pydantic model.
- Modify `src/main.py` to call the `UseCaseGenerator` and log the structured output.
- Add initial unit tests for `src/use_case_generator.py`, potentially mocking LLM API calls.
- Update `progress.md` to reflect these new next steps.

## 4. Key Considerations & Learnings

- LLM prompt engineering will be crucial for the Use Case Generator.
- Robust interaction with diverse external data sources for the MCP/API Search Engine will be complex.
- Asynchronous operations will be important for performance.
- Auto-formatting by the editor needs to be considered for future file modifications (SEARCH/REPLACE blocks).
